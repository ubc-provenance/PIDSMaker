# Dataset preprocessing

PIDSMaker already provides preprocessed versions of the DARPA TC and OpTC and datasets, follow guidelines [here](https://ubc-provenance.github.io/PIDSMaker/ten-minute-install/).

If you want to install a dataset by yourself, we provide our preprocessing scripts to install those datasets. 
Follow the guidelines [here](https://ubc-provenance.github.io/PIDSMaker/create-db-from-scratch/).

# PIDSMaker

The first framework designed to build and experiment with provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSs) using deep learning architectures.
It provides a single codebase to run most recent state-of-the-art systems and easily customize them to develop new variants.

## Purpose

ðŸ¥· PIDSMaker is an open-source framework designed to be collaboratively developed and maintained by the security research community. It was born out of the observation that recent papers in top-tier security venues often evaluate on the same datasets but differ in labeling strategies and in the implementation of baseline methods.

Until now, no standardized open-source framework has existed to facilitate fair comparisons.
PIDSMaker addresses this gap by providing the following key features:

1.	**Consistent evaluation** and benchmarking of SOTA baselines using unified datasets, labeling strategies, and reference implementations.
2.	A modular testbed of existing components extracted from published systems, enabling experimentation and the **discovery of improved variants**.
3.	A centralized repository where authors can contribute and **share code for new systems**, ensuring fair and reproducible benchmarking.
